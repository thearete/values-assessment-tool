# Values Assessment Tool

Assesses organizations against Swedish public agency values (democracy, human rights, LGBTQ+, gender equality) by collecting data from public sources, scoring credibility, and assigning flag ratings (red/yellow/green/grey).

## Usage

```bash
npm install
node src/index.js "Organization Name"
```

## Flag Ratings

- **Red** — Sanctions match, court conviction, 3+ credible sources, or government ruling
- **Yellow** — 2+ indicators from news, NGO reports, or verified sources
- **Green** — No concerns found
- **Grey** — Insufficient data to assess
